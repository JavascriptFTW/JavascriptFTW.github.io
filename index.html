				<p class="heading">About Me</p>
				<p>I am a male homo sapien who enjoys programming, making games, and being flat out crazy.</p>
				<p>I was born and raised on planet Earth during the Information Era and think that it would be really cool if you're reading this sometime after 2100.</p>
				<p class="heading">Projects That I've Made/Contributed To</p>
				<p><a href="2048/index.html">2048</a> - I added some features that were requested but were too far out to make it into the official version</p>
				<p>More coming as I do them!</p>
