		<h1>My Work</h1>
		<ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/cjska-team/Contest-Judging-System-for-KA">Contest Judging System for KA</a> I helped to create this app at the request of Pamela Fox, who was the Computing Curriculum Lead at Khan Academy at the time. The app allows the creation, management, and judging of programming contests on the Khan Academy site</li>
            <li><a href="mrmagma.github.io/Clarif-Viewer-for-KA">Clarification Viewer for KA</a> This app was created when a friend of mine who volunteered for Khan Academy let me know that their clarification management system had broken. I spent a day or so making an initial prototype replacement, which I then gave to my friend who shared it with the Khan Academy content team. The content team loved it, and suggested some improvements, which I implemented quickly. The app now has the ability to view clarifications for any topic on Khan Academy, filtered, tagged, and sorted. The app also includes a simple and secure permissions system to prevent unauthorized users from tampering with features intended for use by the Khan Academy team.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/MrMagma/minesweeper">Minesweeper</a> This simple C++ minesweeper clone runs on the command line and includes the ability to customize the width and height of the game field along with the number of mines spawned.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/MrMagma/fetch">fetch</a> This library allows the creation of servers with request handlers that accept variable paths and can capture and parse data from those paths with Google's language, go.</a>
        </ul>
