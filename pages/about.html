		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I am a hobbyist software developer from the USA specializing in web design. I love learning new languages and finding things that I didn't know about those I have already "learned".</p>
		<p>Other than programming, my hobbies include gaming, reading, writing, game design, and math. I have participated in Ludum Dare, along with creating a few small games using the ProcessingJS library.</p>
		<p>I have a passion for exploring alternate ways that human-machine interaction can be improved. I am not afraid to explore ideas dismissed as "crazy", or "too simple" some of the best inventions in history were insane, and some of the greatest innovations are incredibly simple.</p>
